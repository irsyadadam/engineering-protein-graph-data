# Project Description
Using Text Mining, Knowledge Graph Databases, and Deep Learning Algorithms to construct a sequence predictive model for Drug to Cardiovascular Disease Association.

# Set-up
Using SemRep to extract relevant Subject, Predicate, Object triples from publications pertaining to oxidative stress and related drugs. Construct a knowledge graph database that holds all related information, including relationships between drug and effects on cardiovascular disease. Extract .csv file of drugs and their respective effects, and clean data.

# Run Process
Build an association matrix using the Keras Tokenizer class and construct a sequence predictive model for Cardiovascular Disease and drug associations using Tensorflow and Neural Networks.
